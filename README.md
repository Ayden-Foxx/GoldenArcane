# Golden Arcane: A world of magic within.

> This is a 1.20.1 port of the original Minecraft: Bedrock Edition addon "The Golden Arcane".  
> As with the original, many features are yet to be added, while others are still being ported to the Java version as well.

**Golden Arcane** is a *Minecraft: Java Edition* datapack focusing on simple yet useful mechanics around a same material: gold.  
By drawing obscure magics from this often overlooked metal, players (and at times, even the world itself) may obtain abilities not otherwise attainable before -- or more often than not, find new ways to the same old.

Despite that, though, many other mundane materials may also serve on one's magical journey; Flowers, ores and gems, food and even ordinary blocks may be of relevance to a keen-eyed practicioner. Most "spells" are made with simplicity and ease of use in mind, offering an easy integration with vanilla gameplay.

While working fine on its own, this pack is generally designed with the idea of being a secondary magic path, rather than the only one. As such, overpowered mass-destruction spells are *mostly* not present here; For these, a larger magic mod would be better suited instead.
