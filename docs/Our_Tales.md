# The Lost World

Our Tales was the original *Minecraft: Bedrock Edition* world to contain all features which would then inspire and become **Golden Arcane**. It was accidentally deleted by the operating system, and now lives in memory -- and, hopefully, within this datapack as well.

## Storyline

Our Tales begins in a Snowy Taiga biome, where the player (an unnamed character who writes all notorious in-game events into several books), after living for some while in solitude within a shack between a Snowy Plains and a Taiga forest nearby, decides to explore further beyond, eventually settling just a few hundred blocks besides a Taiga Village, where they build another (rather simple) house and begins writing their first book, documenting the effects of Magic within the world, their daily life there, and eventually records of a strange apparition, a Stray wearing full Golden armor, whom always reappeared at night around roughly the same spot, in a frozen river connecting both the Village and the player's house. With some minor magics and stealth, the player puts a Name Tag on the being to prevent it from leaving their realm, dubbing it *Golden Arrow*.

From there on, the first book mostly records the player and Golden Arrow's interactions, with the former getting increasingly bolder in approaching and confronting other Strays, and the latter getting more dangerous with each night, causing odd events, sending golden helmet-wearing Strays towards the player, and eventually even stepping into their house  while they were gone -- but in reality merely nearby while cloaked in Invisibility to properly observe Golden Arrow's behavior. At a certain point, the player returns to the Village, only to see it nearly deserted, save for the present of another undead, a full Golden armor-wearer Zombie whom the player then dubbed "Golden Knight", theorizing the existence of more "Golden warriors" like Knight and Arrow. Nonetheless, after such events the player flees and exiles themselves from the Taigas to avoid bringing even more destruction unto the land and its inhabitants. While running away (via a boat, travelling through the unfrozen part of the river where it met an oak Forest), they do see a group of regular and Golden armor-wearing Skeletons patrolling a nearby shore, further settling the idea that there *is* some sort of greater organization with Golden enemies -- and perhaps even Gold itself, the precious metal Piglins so loved and which had otherwise been a curious reagent for the player's own magical experiments.

Going far and beyond, with none but a map and a book to guide oneself, the player eventually finds a seashore location just beyond a couple mountains and a swamp, far away from any signs of the permafrost continent they'd found themselves in before. While there, they build a new house, far bigger and more detailed than the two previous, where they would spend most of their time for a while. Writing their second book, the player mostly notes of being out of Golden Arrow's reach (hopefully), and also makes mention of a chicken and its chick, which despite never named, were still around for a long while, even walking around the house while it was being built.

The player's next expedition is to the Nether, where they find regular resources and dangers, but also use Ruined Portals scattered through the Overworld land to connect points of interest around the world. To provide a safer travel between those portals, a huge Quartz bridge is created, with powered rails for travel, Soul Lanterns for lighting (and repelling Piglins), and intersections which could be switched to connect different Portals, depending on where the Player wished to be.
