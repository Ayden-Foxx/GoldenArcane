# Version 0.2.0 - Tenebrous Attack [Indev]

0.2.0 introduces a new mechanic, as well as Golden Arrow's first special attack: Lamina Tenebris.  
Additionally, the update also tweaks several existing functions and add new ones for utility.

## Contents

* Added primary Melee ability for Golden Arrow: Lamina Tenebris.
  * Currently in active development; Respective functions are being slowly added.

* Tweaked Dash ability:
  * Reduced cooldown from -300 to -100 ticks;
  * Reduced trigger from 300 to 150 ticks;
  * Hitting Golden Arrow mid-dash immediately ends the ability.
  * End of ability now properly resets Golden Arrow's timer score.

* Tweaked Teleport: Deflect and Teleport: Ambush abilities:
  * Reduced cooldowns from -300 and -600 to -200 and -100 ticks, respectively;
  * Reduced trigger from 1200 to 600 for both variants.

* Tweaked Heal ability:
  * Reduced trigger from 1800 to 1000 ticks.

* Added new function to remove Golden Arrow's held weaponry.
* Added Vulnerability toggle event.
* Added advancements:
  * "*So That's How It Fell*" (`garrow:defeated_garrow_vulnerable`) - Obtainable by defeating Golden Arrow while it has the `goldark.vulnerable` tag; Challenge type advancement with parent `garrow:defeated_garrow`.

* Tweaked advancements:
  * Renamed `garrow:defeat_garrow` to `garrow:defeated_garrow`.

## Technical

* Added scoreboard objectives:
  * `goldark.ability_timer`, a countdown of the duration of a running active ability;
    * `goldark.ability_clock` will now only focus on counting until the next ability trigger.

  * `goldark.world_difficulty`, a Golden Arcane-specific difficulty meter, synced to the world's vanilla difficulty upon reload.

* Added tags:
  * `garrow.pointer_dummy` - Marks an Armor Stand as a Pointer Dummy; Pointer Dummies are used by Lamina Tenebris to telegraph its area of direct damage.
  * `goldark.add_vulnerability` and `goldark.revoke_vulnerability` - Used by the Vulnerability toggle function to add/remove the `goldark.vulnerable` tag and its effects, respectively.
  * `goldark.vulnerable` - Indicates Golden Arrow's vulnerability state, when it becomes weaker and easier to kill;
  * `goldark.invulnerable` - Indicates Golden Arrow's invulnerability mode, where all attacks become futile on both ends;
  * `goldark.stop_combat` - Prevents Golden Arrow's custom AI from triggering combat functions, generally used along special abilities.

* Tweaked tags:
  * Replaced `garrow.remove` with `garrow.replace`; `garrow.replace` makes Golden Arrow despawn with an alternate effect whenever it is summoned while still alive.
  * `garrow.dash_mode` no longer prevents combat functions from running; This function has been superseded by `goldark.stop_combat`.

* New entity: GArrow Pointer Dummy (modified Armor Stand w `garrow.pointer_dummy` tag).

## Other

* Created `devel` branch for development versions of the project.
* Updated README.md with proper data of current progress in development.
* Created changelog for previous and current versions.
